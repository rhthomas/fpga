Experimenting with FPGA open-source toolchains.

## Tools

The FPGA that is developed on is the [iCEstick](www.latticesemi.com/icestick)
from Lattice Semiconductor.

The device is programmed using the on-board FTDI interface, and the
[apio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio) ecosystem project. This expands on
other FPGA open-source tools such as
[icestorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/) and
[iverilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) among others.
