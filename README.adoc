== Tools
The FPGA that is developed on is the [iCEstick](www.latticesemi.com/icestick)
from Lattice Semiconductor.

The device is programmed using the on-board FTDI interface, and the
https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio[apio] ecosystem project. This expands on
other FPGA open-source tools such as
http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/[icestorm] and
http://iverilog.icarus.com/[iverilog] among others.
